synopsis: Simple tools for communicating sequential processes
description:
    Hoare was rightâ€”many concurrent programs can be simply expressed
    as a series of concurrent actors (threads) consuming and producing
    messages. Haskell provides uniquely great tools (green threads and STM)
    for doing so. This package provides:

    - Functions for using bounded STM types like
      `TBQueue` and `TMVar` as /channels/ between threads.

    - A /closeable/ @TBCQueue@ for programs where the input ends.
